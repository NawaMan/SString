# SString Library (Simple String)

A modern C++ string library with robust Unicode support and efficient memory management. SString provides a safe and performant way to handle text in C++, with full UTF-8 and UTF-16 support.

## Features
- Full Unicode support (UTF-8/UTF-16)
- Efficient memory management with copy-on-write
- Comprehensive character access and manipulation
- Robust handling of invalid UTF-8 sequences
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Extensive test coverage

## Requirements
- C++20 or later
- CMake 3.10 or later
- Boost library
- Google Test (for testing)

## Installation

### From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nawaman/SString.git
cd SString

# Build and test locally
./build-locally.sh
```

### Using Package Manager
Download the appropriate package for your system from the releases:
- DEB package (Debian/Ubuntu)
- RPM package (Red Hat/Fedora)
- ZIP archive (Windows)
- TGZ archive (Unix-like systems)

## Usage
```cpp
#include "sstring.hpp"

using namespace simple_string;

// Create strings
SString str1{"Hello, ä¸–ç•Œ!"};
SString str2{"ðŸŒŸ Stars"};  // Emoji support

// Access characters
auto ch = str1.char_at(7);  // Gets 'ä¸–'

// Safe handling of invalid UTF-8
SString invalid{"\xFF\xFE"};  // Invalid UTF-8 bytes
// Automatically replaced with U+FFFD (replacement character)
```

The real reason to write this library is for Java developers like myself to use Java-style string in C++.
