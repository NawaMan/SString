# Task-006: Improve Test Coverage

## Objective
Improve branch coverage of the SString class by adding comprehensive test cases for invalid UTF-8 sequences, edge cases, and UTF-16 specific scenarios.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Test Coverage Status
- Initial Coverage:
  - Lines: 100% (10/10 lines)
  - Functions: 100% (2/2 functions)
  - Branches: 55.6% (10/18 branches)

### 2. Key Areas Addressed
1. **Character Access Tests**
   - Empty string handling
   - Edge cases around string length boundaries
   - UTF-16 surrogate pair boundary conditions
   - Various string index scenarios (start, middle, end)

2. **Invalid UTF-8 Sequence Tests**
   - Single invalid bytes
   - Invalid 2-byte, 3-byte, and 4-byte sequences
   - Incomplete UTF-8 sequences
   - Overlong encodings
   - Surrogate ranges and out-of-range scenarios

### 3. Implementation Changes
1. **Test Files Added/Modified**
   - `sstring_char_access_test.cpp`: Comprehensive character access tests
   - `sstring_invalid_utf8_test.cpp`: Invalid UTF-8 sequence tests

2. **Test Categories**
   - Basic ASCII access
   - UTF-8 string access
   - Surrogate pair access
   - Boundary conditions
   - Mixed string access
   - Invalid UTF-8 handling
   - Incomplete UTF-8 sequences
   - Overlong encodings
   - Surrogate range and out-of-range UTF-8

3. **Code Modifications**
   - Updated `get_utf16` method to handle invalid UTF-8 sequences correctly
   - Implemented proper replacement character (U+FFFD) handling
   - Added support for various edge cases in character access

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests cover both valid and invalid input scenarios
- Edge cases are explicitly tested
- Error conditions are verified
- UTF-16 surrogate pair handling is validated
- Invalid sequence handling is confirmed

## Results
All tests pass successfully, demonstrating:
1. Proper handling of invalid UTF-8 sequences
2. Correct character access across different string types
3. Appropriate error handling for boundary conditions
4. Consistent use of replacement characters for invalid sequences

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding more tests for:
   - Memory handling edge cases
   - Large string scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks for different string operations
   - Additional UTF-8/UTF-16 edge cases

## Dependencies
- Boost (for string handling and encoding conversions)
- Google Test (for unit testing)
- CMake (for build system)
- lcov (for coverage reporting)
