# Task-001

## Description

Initial task to setup the project and get started with C++ development to produce
- a library for Java string immitation using Boost Locale.
- infrastructure for building and testing the library.
- the initial class of SString (simple string).
- SString has can be initialized from C++ string litteral and can tell its length.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Setup the project with CMake
- [x] Setup the library with Boost Locale
- [x] Setup the testing infrastructure
- [x] Setup the build infrastructure
- [x] Implement SString class
    - [x] Implement SString constructor from C++ string litteral
    - [x] Implement SString::length() method
    - [x] Implement SString::equals() method
    - [x] Implement SString::compareTo() method

## Additional Completed Features
- Immutable string implementation with const guarantees
- Proper UTF-8 and null character handling
- Comprehensive test suite for all functionality
