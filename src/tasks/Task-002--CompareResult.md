# Task-002: CompareResult

## Motivation

`compareTo()` returns an integer that indicates the relative order of the strings
  which is sometimes hard to remember.
It should be good to have a `CompareResult` class to make the code more readable.

## Description

Add CompareResult class that can implicitly convert from int -- so that it can be used in the same way as the return value of `compareTo()`. 
Add some method to make the code more readable such as:

- isLess()
- isGreater()
- isEqual()
- isLessOrEqual()
- isGreaterOrEqual()


## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add CompareResult class
- [ ] Add implicit conversion from int to CompareResult
- [ ] Add isLess() method
- [ ] Add isGreater() method
- [ ] Add isEqual() method
- [ ] Add isLessOrEqual() method
- [ ] Add isGreaterOrEqual() method
